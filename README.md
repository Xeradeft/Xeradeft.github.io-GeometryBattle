3. Hosts the website for my Website Design & HTML (with PEAR Review) A2

    - Topic 3: Independent Flour Mills
        - A lot more people have started baking at home over the past few years, yet not all flour is created equal. Canada produces a lot of exceptional boutique flours, often in small independent mills. Examples include Flourist, True Grain, and K2 Milling.
        - Task: Create a website which describes the various types of flour available in Canada, and the independent mills that produce them. Explore the things that make the flours from these mills unique.

4. Hosts the website for my Build a Website: HTML & CSS A3

    - Topic: Jujutsu Kaisen: Manga vs Anime
        - For many popular series, people always debate whether you should read the manga or watch the anime adaptation. After reading this, you'll know what's best for you as we discuss the differences, while highlighting the pros and cons for each consumption method.
        - Task: Build a website with at least 3 separate pages including a basic design, content, HTML, and CSS styling.  The website needs to be composed of a home entry page, 2 ancillary pages that are linked to and linked back from the home page, a CSS style file, and a custom (and fun) 404 error message page (standalone, clearly wrong place, advice to get back on track, and option to get in touch with website owner).
          - Required design elements of all pages: menu of links to other pages, custom header graphic, footer with contact info, responsive design, properly formatted media files
