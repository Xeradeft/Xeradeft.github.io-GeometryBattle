                <h2>About Wave Financial Inc.</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Wave Financial Inc. created award-winning financial software designed for entrepreneurs. Their products are
                    pitched as a better way to make, move, and manage money, where every Wave product brings a small business owner closer to
                    a complete picture of financial success. For instance, Wave’s accounting and invoicing products are free, whereas their
                    payments solution is pay-per-use and their payroll solution is priced using a monthly base fee with additional costs
                    based on number of payees. Wave’s software solutions are targeted towards entrepreneurs and small business owners since
                    they greatly ease the financial management burden and allow them to become more professional. Furthermore, Wave strives
                    to help their clients build skills, get inspired, and empower themselves and they more recently started offering the Wave
                    Advisors service, which allows clients to book personal meetings and receive VIP treatment from in-house bookkeepers,
                    accounting coaches, and payroll coaches. For example, bookkeeping and payroll support advisors can help run numbers and
                    do calculations by assisting clients with categorization, account reconciliation, payroll and employee setup, timesheet
                    inputs, payroll runs, accountant collaboration, and monthly review calls. Whereas for accounting and payroll coaching, a
                    dedicated professional helps keep a client on the right track through hourly sessions of live coaching or months of email
                    support, for various things from reviewing and correcting an existing account to even setting up or migrating to Wave. I
                    was honoured to spend the past 8 months during my W21 and S21 co-op work terms working a position with the Financial
                    Capabilities (Payments) software engineering team at Wave, where I primarily engaged in and led development for the
                    <i>“Risk Toolbox”</i> (RT) project initiative.

                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately due to the chaos and impact of COIVD-19, my original co-op placement in Toronto at Wave
                    Financial Inc. was cancelled for the summer of 2020. However, I was able to keep in touch and land another work term for
                    my next winter 2021 work term. Furthermore, I really liked it here and we were able to extend my co-op into the summer!
                    For the past 8 months, I proudly worked as a software engineering intern on the Financial Capabilities team, formerly
                    known as the Payments team. Although this position was instead a remote job working from home (WFH), I was luckily able
                    to spend one day late August in the office with my team when things were getting better and beginning to open up, and the
                    Wave HQ office in Toronto is amazing and totally worth the trip!

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;Our Financial Capabilities team deals with many different products and areas of our codebase, all
                    directly involving clients, customers, and real money movement. We were a fairly large team of about 8-10 engineers, one
                    team lead, one project manager, one designer, and one business lead, in turn making us one of the largest teams in the
                    company. Our team was also transitioning to find a suitable agile scrum workflow cycle. To match our large team size, we
                    were usually working on multiple initiatives simultaneously other than handling point-of-contact and on-call issues, as
                    well as continuous “Service Up” iterations and improvements. Generally at Wave, it’s employees call it a “Django Python
                    shop,” as I was told by team leaders. They called it this because nearly all of our code and apps are written in Python,
                    which I quickly noticed and agreed with in my first few days of training and onboarding.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;When I was hired, I was told about a cool new project that I would have the opportunity to lead that
                    they originally called the Merchant Toolbox initiative, where I would be implementing multiple different third-party APIs
                    for a new internal tool designed for Wave’s risk analyst team. It was later more accurately dubbed the Risk Toolbox
                    initiative and was where I focussed nearly all of my capacity at work. As expected, I spent a large portion of my time
                    working and honing my skills with Python while developing the Central Risk backend of the new Risk Toolbox initiative
                    that I was the lead developer for. In addition, I also received the opportunity to directly work on and learn more about
                    HTML, CSS, SCSS, and functional React with webhooks when we created the web interface of the tool. I even got a senior
                    programmer to mentor me about this in my second term through discussions, multiple one-on-ones, pair programming, and
                    code review sessions!
                </p>

                <!-- <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Since there were only assigned tasks and projects void of literally any training or onboarding or anything
                    like that, I never had a proper developer environment setup. Something that is important to note: due to COVID-19 many
                    services were cancelled or shut down, which includes the following Moneris-related tasks I worked on. This meant that
                    I had the luxury of testing using the live system instead of locally. Of course I would test some small pieces locally,
                    but never ran a copy of the entire system from my computer to test it as a whole.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;For the projects I completed besides the PDF task, I was required to use virtual machines (VMs) and
                    connect using GoToAssist to access and edit the hosted app code or database. In the VM, there were many different
                    editors/IDEs available, such as VS Code, Notepad++, MS Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Express for Web. I was told
                    to work directly on the VM, but I also did a lot of work locally before porting it to the VM for testing. Overall, I
                    used VS Code and Notepad++ the most since they were the most convenient and fastest for the changes I was making,
                    especially since I was already familiar with them. I also used other applications I was adept with like MS Office (eg.
                    Word and Excel); however, I used Adobe Acrobat Pro DC and got to try out the pro features, particularly during my PDF task.
                    We used Oracle and SQL databases, which were managed using MS SQL Server 2014 Management Studio within the VM when
                    not accessed and used by program code. On the other hand, most code I dealt with was primarily in C#, CSHTML, Razor,
                    MVC 3, including ASP.NET core and framework, as well as JavaScript for Adobe PDF scripting and a little bit of PHP.
                    I was happy to obtain experience learning with so many different languages that were entirely new to me at this co-op,
                    but I also learned about my preference for a proper work flow and development environment.

                <!-- Work Highlights -->
                <h2>Work Highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;During my time at Wave, I spent nearly all of my time on the Risk Toolbox initiative. Essentially, this
                    project’s goal was to create an internal tool for our risk analysts so they no longer needed to use flaky, fragile,
                    high-maintenance web scraping scripts. Not only did these scripts written by a risk analyst frequently not work and
                    require fixing by other developers at Wave, these would also non-compliantly store sensitive personal information in
                    plain text fields as notes in some internal tools. In turn, our Risk Toolbox solution would instead directly interact
                    with relevant third-party APIs in order to obtain the same information, even better data in some cases, in a more secure,
                    reliable, and maintainable fashion. Additionally, we would construct a fresh new web interface for the risk analysts as
                    part of the Risk Toolbox.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;The first third-party API to be implemented was TransUnion, which would later be followed by Ekata,
                    PLAID, GIACT, and LexisNexus. Leveraging these would allow risk analysts to have a much better medium to interact with
                    and use, greatly improving their workflow efficiency and saving lots of time when identifying fraid flash and verifying
                    credit report, name, address, and bank account information. For TransUnion alone, it would save risk analysts
                    approximately 10+ hours each week! Another cool point of this project’s design was that it incorporated a database to act
                    as a caching mechanism to store encrypted responses from the third party APIs for reuse in the future until we deem them
                    outdated. This feature would save the company lots of money in the future by reducing the number of costly API calls made
                    to the various third party APIs.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;Of the different parts of the Risk Toolbox solution, I spent most of my time on the Central Risk
                    backend component written in Python with typing as well as the frontend component we called Sonar (formerly called Radar)
                    of the Central Admin internal tool where the Risk Toolbox resided. More specifically, Sonar consisted of HTML, CSS, SCSS,
                    and React that also utilized Wave’s custom component libraries known as Bouyant, Lighthouse, and Lightship. As part of
                    the data transport between the different applications involved, I also learned a lot about RPC and RPCX, Google Protocol
                    Buffers (protobufs), and encryption in transit and at rest. Specifically, we used AWS Encryption Keys and Fernet to meet
                    compliance requirements for encryption in transit and at rest, which proved quite challenging as it was an entirely new
                    concept that I could not handle entirely alone because it required many cross-team discussions that included leaders.
                    This was especially true if it concerned determining aspects of operations engineering and developer operations within
                    local, test, staging, and production environments. In addition, I got to obtain more experience with GraphQL through
                    Sonar, which would make GQL queries to a middleware application known as Reef that would communicate with the Central
                    Risk backend to make and return data from third party API calls. It also communicated with Coastguard, the backend of
                    Central Admin, for user verification and authentication so we could ensure only risk analysts and other employees with
                    the proper permissions were able to view sensitive information.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;Fortunately, I was permitted to keep copies of some things from my work term, which included various
                    things. More importantly, I was allowed to include a copy of the video recording that shows when I did an early company
                    demo for the Risk Toolbox project for my work term report since it did not show any code or sensitive information.
                    **Once I process the video, I'll upload it here.

                <ol>
                    <!-- W21: WFH Term 1 Goals -->
                    <li>
                        <strong>CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Creativity:</strong>
                        <b>Wave Mentorship Program: Mobile App</b>

                        <br /><u>Goal</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Using this opportunity, it is my goal to take initiative and be creative when creating a mobile
                        application and heeding the advice of my mentor with years of experience developing mobile apps. It is important
                        to note that this is meant to be an opportunity for the mentee, and as such, the mentor is there for guidance and
                        to provide veteran advice, not to work on the project.

                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;First, research possible languages and decide on what the app will be made in (eg. React-Native)
                        and what platforms it will be created for (eg. iOS, Android, both). After brainstorming and establishing a loosely
                        concrete app idea, my mentor and I agreed this side project will go through the following general process after
                        the core concept is decided:
                        <br />&emsp;(1) Screen and navigation design (sketch and/or figma prototype)
                        <br />&emsp;(2) Data requirements (at a per screen/navigation basis)
                        <br />&emsp;(3) Modular UI component design and implementation (potentially using component libraries)
                        <br />&emsp;(4) Storage considerations (local vs online vs hybrid)
                        <br />&emsp;(5) Backend/Database considerations (eg. React-Native, Flutter; eg. firebase, AWS amplify)
                        <br />&emsp;(6) Write the list of network CRUD methods needed
                        <br />&emsp;(7) Hook up services with their components
                        Note: The above is a general outline for the development process of the mobile app, which means that additional
                        features and capabilities are not accounted for. These would be stretch goals, although priorities may change and
                        a new desire to work on a specific feature can take over. This is a hands-on learning experience with a mentor in
                        the form of a side-project, so it should not be restricted by strict plans.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;This opportunity with a mentor is designed to be a learning experience, not meant to necessarily
                        have any tangible results or outcomes, but rather the experience and knowledge gained from the process. Besides my
                        personal opinion about success with regards to this, my mentor will also be able to provide their opinion,
                        especially because they are knowledgeable and experienced as this is their area of expertise. In addition, a
                        shallow form of evaluation could include how much of the previously outlined plan and original process was
                        completed, as well as how satisfied we both are with the quality.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Overall, this goal was achieved through multiple discussions about the project and outlining the
                        general process of development because it facilitated a good learning environment where I was able to learn from an
                        experienced mobile engineer at Wave. As expected of the short-term mentorship side project, not much time or effort
                        was allocated for it because it meant sacrificing productivity and capacity on the Risk Toolbox initiative, where I
                        was the sole and/or lead developer. Consequently, this unfortunately resulted in no actual mobile app being created,
                        just as my mentor, Kenny Lam, had warned at the beginning of the mentorship. However, I still gained valuable
                        knowledge from an experienced developer and would be able to utilize it if I choose to create the designed app in
                        the future. For example, I added the general outline of the project to the action plan, which was one of the the
                        results of our discussions and conversations.

                        this project, where I will basically be the sole developer, in turn, also making me a leader. Wave’s risk analysts
                        use many different services’ portals to gather required info about a consumer during analysis, and each requires a
                        login. So, a risk analyst (not a developer) made a web scraping script to do this process and collect info for an
                        analyst instead of them doing it manually, consequently halving the time spent. Unfortunately, this is not really
                        maintained and quite fragile (due to the nature of web scraping), so there are usually problems. Since the developer
                        of this script isn’t a coder, there’s typically a lot of time spent trying to fix these kinds of errors since
                        analysts depend on this script to improve their workflow. As a solution, the Merchant Toolbox initiative project will
                        replace the fragile web scraping script with a professional internal tool for risk analysts at Wave by establishing
                        API connections and retrieving info and displaying it in UI instead. My goal is to hone to and improve my leadership
                        qualities with this opportunity, including vision, direction, guidance, and communication.

                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;In order to complete such a large project where I am lacking in domain knowledge of Wave’s systems,
                        it will be extremely important to communicate regularly and effectively with many people and involved parties so I
                        can learn and ramp up into the working developer environments at Wave. Similarly, communication and cooperation with
                        many involved groups will be vital to the progress of the Merchant Toolbox initiative. For instance, coordinating
                        with my team, supervisor, TransUnion contacts, risk analysts, and security and compliance officers. Through
                        communication, I will be able to efficiently and effectively learn and construct and vision with direction, in turn
                        allowing me to provide accurate guidance about the project. Once I reach this point, I will persevere and complete
                        all tasks to the best of my ability while also maintaining and carrying out the role of a leader for the project.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;As I work on this initiative, I will be reporting to a supervisor that is a senior engineer. They
                        are also a veteran developer with experience leading project initiatives, so they will be able to give accurate
                        measures of my success. In addition to examining the quality of the process and outcome of work for each API
                        developed, it is possible to consider the quantity of APIs completed even if this is a shallow way of measuring
                        success. Loosely, it is expected that the first API (TransUnion) will take approximately 2-3 months. More importantly,
                        they will be able to provide reliable constructive criticism on the qualitative aspects of leadership and
                        communication I show while working on the project.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;This initiative was an amazing opportunity for which I am grateful because I was able to start a
                        new project and be involved in the analysis and design phases of development, which was new to me. For the majority
                        of my term, I was the sole developer besides my direct supervisor, Alex Georgie, who architected the Risk Toolbox
                        initiative (formerly known as the Merchant Toolbox). Later on, development ramped up and required more capacity than
                        I was capable of by myself. Thus, more people on my team started to work on this initiative with me. I was in charge
                        of getting everyone up to speed and effectively communicating the progress and short term goals for each sprint. In
                        this regard, I believe I showed great initiative, organization, and leadership for the opportunity presented - my
                        supervisor also complimented me for these same things.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;My supervisor and I were very satisfied with how I achieved my goal because I was able to experience
                        leading development by myself, contributing from the start of the design phase of the architecture and demonstrating
                        continued leadership when more people were added to further develop the initiative. Furthermore, my supervisor
                        consistently praised my ability to communicate and further improved my communication skills, especially with respect
                        to the cross-team and external third-party communication required in this initiative. Personally, I enjoyed learning
                        how to efficiently and appropriately communicate between all the involved parties in a professional, effective, and
                        timely manner.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, one of the measures of successes I provided for this goal used the number of
                        completed APIs, which truly did end up being a shallow measure of success because this project was underestimated by
                        those involved. We experienced changing scope, requirements, design, and even the burdens of heavy cross-team
                        communication, which all contributed to increasing the time and effort required for this project in turn rendering
                        many initial estimates to be much too low. For example, a major change was when I identified we needed to meet the
                        compliance requirement of both encryption in transit and rest for credit report information as it contained sensitive
                        personal info about its subject person. Consequently, this required a significant impact on design where we eventually
                        decided to incorporate a solution that utilized the AWS Encryption SDK to handle encryption in transit, something that
                        was a brand new implementation for the organization and required many discussions with leaders in the company.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Overall, this was an amazing opportunity and will be a valuable experience in my career and I was
                        ecstatic to hear such positive comments from senior developers and leaders about my work on this project. Personally,
                        I really enjoyed working on this project as it allowed me to learn many things as well as hone my leadership and other
                        interpersonal skills in a professional environment.

                        <br /><u>Goal</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Learn and experience a professional environment that utilizes Python in the majority of their
                        codebase. Especially, with respect to learning about classes in Python, which I have not gained much exposure to in
                        school.

                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;As I work at Wave, I will be exposed to many different repositories of Python code since most of
                        the apps and services here are built using Python / Django. Throughout my co-op placement at Wave, I will ask to work
                        in these areas and continuously strive to learn more about the programming language. In addition, I will converse
                        with others who are experienced in order to learn more. I will also attend as many technical knowledge shares and
                        tech huddles to learn even more about the programming language and its possible uses while accumulating domain
                        knowledge. In addition, I will try to pair with other experienced programmers on work in this area when possible so I
                        can further hone my skills in a more intimate setting with direct feedback.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;When I make code changes, I will always have multiple experienced developers review my code. By
                        doing this, I will be able to get veteran programmers to bestow their knowledge and experience to me through formal
                        and informal reviews and iterative improvements of the code I write. Each successful modification, improvement,
                        review, and push of code will act as a measure of success towards improving my knowledge and technical skill in
                        Python. Additionally, feedback from my supervisor, teammates, and collaborators can be used to gauge my progress and
                        success.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Suffice to say, this was definitely accomplished throughout the duration of my co-op placement
                        because I spent a significant portion working on the Django Python backend, including both prototype, core, auxiliary,
                        and test code. Whenever I made changes, I would make an effort to reach out to multiple senior developers experienced
                        with Python to have them review my PRs. In addition, I would specifically try to incorporate some senior developers
                        on different teams in order to get an even greater range of feedback on how things can be improved. This effort was
                        very fruitful as I received lots of comments and feedback from many people, which led to a significant amount of
                        interesting conversations and discussions on different solutions and general best practices, including different
                        methodologies and approaches depending on the team and repository codebase being reviewed. Moreover, I was able to
                        learn some things on my own from reviewing others' code and furthering my own knowledge.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, my team was amazing and even prepared subdomain knowledge sharing sessions about many
                        different topics within our organizational codebase. We also conducted weekly tech huddles in addition to the usual
                        team and company demos. I was successfully able to attend nearly all of these different opportunities to share and
                        absorb knowledge largely about, but not limited to, Python since many different people discussed other languages,
                        tech, and tools from. I tried to make the best use of these knowledge sharing sessions and even began utilizing the
                        smaller “tips and tricks” in my own work whenever the situation allowed for it. Learning professional Python and
                        having many veteran developers contribute to honing my knowledge and skills has allowed me to establish a solid
                        foundation in Python where I am confident with my work. To my satisfaction, I also received praise from my supervisor
                        when he personally reviewed my PRs and I was very happy to receive compliments when he was impressed with my work.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, as I continued to pursue this goal throughout my time at Wave, I was able to
                        participate and lead multiple pair programming and mobbing sessions. These were great mediums to quickly transfer
                        practical and useful knowledge while directly applying them to our current work. For example, I paired and mobbed on
                        Python code development and testing work both internally within my team and in a cross-team environment. These
                        experiences helped solidify my belief that pairing on work or even just code review definitely has its place in a
                        professional workplace when executed properly. Personally, I find it even more useful when ramping someone up on a
                        project, working on complicated problems and issues, and when starting a new feature or design that requires a
                        different approach from the typical work someone is accustomed to.

                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;As I work at Wave on my Risk Toolbox project initiative, I will be exposed to frontend development
                        in our Sonar app that uses React. I will show my desire and initiative to work in this area in order to gain
                        knowledge and experience in a professional workplace setting. I will also discuss things with other knowledgeable
                        developers and employees in order to further grow my understanding. In addition, I will try to pair with other

                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;I executed the action plan exactly as detailed. After taking the initiative to express my interest
                        and telling my supervisor about this goal, I received many opportunities to work in our Sonar codebase and gain more
                        experience with HTML, CSS, SCSS, and React. Through my work, PRs, and code reviews, I was able to learn and improve
                        my web development skills through discussions with others. Specifically, my SCSS and React skills progressed a
                        significant amount because I previously did not have much experience with these two.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, I was able to pair with my friend and co-worker, Erik Hoffman, for many of the Sonar
                        tasks and he helped mentor and teach me professional and general good habits for this web development stack. He
                        provided honest, great feedback and also complimented me on my organization skills. In particular, he was very
                        impressed and praised me for my strong desire and ability to learn and quickly begin utilizing the new knowledge and
                        skills. I found that pair programming with him worked very well and I was able to learn a lot from our direct
                        interactions during the React development. Later on, I was even able to set everything up and complete Sonar tasks by
                        myself.

                        <br /><u>Goal</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;This is a priceless, valuable skill usable anywhere and everywhere that has also become more
                        important in the virtual work environments we see more often today. For example, more messages are sent because
                        people work from home instead of meeting or face-to-face talks in the office.

                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Throughout day-to-day work activities and interactions where I engage in written communication and
                        collaboration, I will practice conveying tone and voice effectively through writing. For example, this entails any
                        messages, emails, or chats I send to others. In order to do so effectively and efficiently, I will read some articles
                        on the topic to improve my knowledge and awareness as well as ask for professional advice from my peers, coworkers,
                        and supervisors.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;In order to gauge my progress and evaluate my tone and voice in written messages, I will install
                        and use the Grammarly extension. This extension evaluates my messages and lets me know my score for tone and voice.
                        It will also send me email reports on my message trends to help me track progress. Using the extension’s scoring
                        system and tone/voice recognition, 5 stars in desirable, positive areas indicates good tone and voice, whereas low
                        scores in those areas and/or high scores in undesirable, negative areas indicates poor progress. Other than using the
                        Grammarly extension, feedback from my supervisor, teammates, and collaborators can be used to gauge my progress and
                        success.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Previously, I practiced writing in a neutral tone and voice as that is what I have learned and
                        practiced since high school. However, this can lead to misunderstandings since it is easy for a reader to look at it
                        and interpret it negatively. Therefore, I made it my goal to practice writing in a positive tone and voice so it
                        won’t be accidentally misread. After announcing my goal and attention to my team and others I worked and communicated
                        with, I gathered their feedback periodically in order to gauge my progress in a qualitative manner and look for
                        constructive criticism. I was happy to achieve my goal of having everyone positively agree that my tone and voice for
                        written communication has improved and no longer is presented in such a neutral tone. In fact, many of my co-workers
                        complimented me on being upbeat, positive, and always displaying such good energy. To everyone’s amusement, some of
                        my co-workers even gave me kudos on my use of emojis and GIFs. It started a trend where they started to be used more
                        frequently and I think it brightened up everyone’s day a little bit.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;With regards to the Grammarly extension, it worked really well even if it was still in beta.
                        Unfortunately, my account never received history tracking of how my overall tone and voice changed over a weekly
                        basis. However, my team leader personally tried to keep track of this for my co-op goal. He was very pleased with the
                        improvement of my written communication and said that I consistently demonstrated a positive tone and voice. A large
                        part of my success was due to Grammarly since it would display up to 3 different qualitative categories for tone and
                        voice on a 5-star scale. I leveraged this to ensure that the messages and emails I wrote were always 4-5 star rating
                        in the positive connotation categories of its tone detector (such as Friendly, Optimistic, Appreciative, Encouraging,
                        Excited, etc.) while avoiding neutral and negative connotation categories (such as Forceful, Angry, Egocentric,
                        Neutral, Accusatory, Argumentative, etc.). Although I most probably will not be consistently using it on my personal
                        computer, I will definitely consider looking at the Grammarly extension for its tone detector when it is further
                        improved and polished.

                    &emsp;&emsp;Over the past 8 months at Wave, I learned many things, continuously improved my knowledge, and honed multiple
                    skills. Not only were the workplace culture and my team amazing, but even the company as a whole carried themselves in
                    such a unique and positive way despite only having virtual platforms for communication when working from home during the
                    pandemic. This was such an amazing opportunity and I really enjoyed my time working at Wave because of the friends I made
                    and the important work we did to empower small business owners. Everyone was very supportive of me as a co-op especially,
                    providing me with many challenges and opportunities to learn and apply my skills. To continue, I’m especially honoured to
                    have been trusted with leading development for an important project that will be constantly used by our risk analysts
                    because it allowed me to obtain professional experience for all parts of software development besides the typical
                    implementation phase. Of all my co-op experiences, this was definitely the most enjoyable and I would strongly consider
                    a future full-time position at Wave if given an official offer.

                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I would like to give a special thank you to the following people from Hospitality Services whom I worked
                    with for making an impact on my experience this summer and contributing to my personal and professional growth:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Altaf Virani, Assistant Director - Information Technology</li>
                    <li>Munny Malik, Assistant Manager - Information Technology</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Although I rarely interacted with Munny, I want to thank her for talking with me a little bit every time
                    she came in to work - actually talking to another person once in a while was nice after being alone in the office
                    every day. Even if it was brief, it was also a pleasure to work together when designing and creating a PDF form.
                    Last but not least, Altaf, my supervisor and only mentor during my co-op placement. I always enjoyed chatting with
                    you during the small respites between your busy schedule for us to update each other about work. Even when it was
                    not about the current projects, we usually got a good laugh or two every day.
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;I understand the difficulties we faced over the summer kept you quite busy, especially as you had
                    to make sure on-campus Hospitality Services was prepared for the return of classes and students coming back to
                    campus. Despite everything, you still tried your best to make me feel welcome and be available if I had any questions
                    about my work. I am very thankful for working with everyone and you can rest assured that I will remember and
                    transfer the many things I learned during my co-op term here into my other endeavors.
