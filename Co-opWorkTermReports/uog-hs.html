                <h2>About Hospitality Services</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;At the University of Guelph, Hospitality Services organizes a multitude of things on campus for students
                    and staff alike, also creating many job opportunities on campus. This division has influenced and managed many
                    services including: food services with off-campus partners and on-campus meal plans; the University Campus Bookstore
                    for textbooks, office supplies, and university-affiliated clothing in MacNaughton; Gryph’s Locker for athletic apparel
                    and accessories in the Guelph Gryphons Athletics Centre; and even student-run organizations with parallel goals, such
                    as the Student Nutrition Awareness Program (SNAP) and Student Ombudsperson. Of course, Hospitality Services is best
                    known for their amazing food services and being ranked the #1 food service in Canada by Maclean’s Magazine for the
                    past 10 years in a row. Like many other large organizations, Hospitality Services as a division within the university
                    has multiple departments relating to different areas of the experience. My position for the S20 co-op term was with
                    the information technology department of Hospitality Services, where I dealt with all the behind-the-scenes systems
                    and applications that others use daily.

                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;As you probably know, COVID-19 caused a lot of chaos starting March and continued to affect everyone into
                    the summer, which also unfortunately led to the cancellation of my original co-op placement in Toronto at Wave
                    Financial Inc. However, I managed to land this position after beginning my co-op search for the second time during the
                    semester. For the last 2 months of the summer, I worked for the University of Guelph, Hospitality Services - Information
                    Technology department as an application developer / web design and was stationed in an office room in the basement of
                    Express Centre, Creelman Hall (see images above to get an idea of where I worked during my co-op). Since I was excited
                    to receive such an opportunity very late in the summer, I accepted the loose job description of “application development
                    and general computing support” and started working the same day as the interview.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;Working here, I received the opportunity to further improve my knowledge about financial technologies
                    while dealing with some of the payment systems behind meal plans and convocation ticker orders / gown rentals. During
                    this co-op, I interacted with databases more often and more directly in comparison to my last time, which is something
                    I was looking forward to. Certainly, everything I did here was almost entirely new to me and I was constantly learning
                    new things - see the “Tools and Technologies” section below for what I learned technically. I enjoyed this challenge 
                    and it helped me create small goals throughout my term. For instance, besides transferable skills, I only had minimal
                    experience with C#, yet it was the primary language I worked with throughout the co-op term. The kind of work I did was
                    very general and pretty much anything random that was tech-related could be assigned to me: web apps, dev ops, databases,
                    back-end, and front-end. I pretty much did a bit of everything and would almost classify this position as full-stack due
                    to the variation of tasks given to me.

                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;In addition, I gained firsthand experience of how daily life is as an individual programmer without a
                    team (nor anyone to ask for help) besides a boss/supervisor to report to occasionally. Once again, I think it was good
                    to see the other extreme of the spectrum where there are next to no meetings if any at all, let alone any normal
                    communication or assistance, especially when compared to the seemingly never-ending queue of meetings at NCR.
                    Despite some small struggles, it was an interesting experience where I learned many new things and I am thankful for
                    being able to work a co-op term this summer here.
                </p>

                <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Since there were only assigned tasks and projects void of literally any training or onboarding or anything
                    like that, I never had a proper developer environment setup. Something that is important to note: due to COVID-19 many
                    services were cancelled or shut down, which includes the following Moneris-related tasks I worked on. This meant that
                    I had the luxury of testing using the live system instead of locally. Of course I would test some small pieces locally,
                    but never ran a copy of the entire system from my computer to test it as a whole.
                    
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;For the projects I completed besides the PDF task, I was required to use virtual machines (VMs) and
                    connect using GoToAssist to access and edit the hosted app code or database. In the VM, there were many different
                    editors/IDEs available, such as VS Code, Notepad++, MS Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Express for Web. I was told
                    to work directly on the VM, but I also did a lot of work locally before porting it to the VM for testing. Overall, I
                    used VS Code and Notepad++ the most since they were the most convenient and fastest for the changes I was making,
                    especially since I was already familiar with them. I also used other applications I was adept with like MS Office (eg.
                    Word and Excel); however, I used Adobe Acrobat Pro DC and got to try out the pro features, particularly during my PDF task.
                    We used Oracle and SQL databases, which were managed using MS SQL Server 2014 Management Studio within the VM when
                    not accessed and used by program code. On the other hand, most code I dealt with was primarily in C#, CSHTML, Razor,
                    MVC 3, including ASP.NET core and framework, as well as JavaScript for Adobe PDF scripting and a little bit of PHP.
                    I was happy to obtain experience learning with so many different languages that were entirely new to me at this co-op,
                    but I also learned about my preference for a proper work flow and development environment.

                    <p>Note: There are more details about Moneris and the PDF tasks in the Goals section below.</p>
                    <li>
                        Greatly exceeded expectations by remaking a form from scratch using MS Word and then using Adobe Acrobat Pro DC to
                        make it fillable and automate/script everything as much as possible. I created this
                        <em><a href="uog-hs/Sales and Solicitation Request Form.pdf" target="_blank">new form</a></em>
                        by referencing the <em><a href="uog-hs/Sales and Solicitation Request Form -original.pdf" target="_blank">old PDF paper form</a></em>
                        they provided and redoing it entirely. I even included thorough
                        <em><a href="uog-hs/Sales and Solicitation Request Form Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">documentation</a></em>
                        detailing how to use and modify both the original word document and PDF, including the scripting and all
                        automated and fillable elements as well as how someone would be able to make a form like this from scratch.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated Moneris as a third-party credit card payment system after reading A LOT of their documentation and
                        determining the best option for our system. This was done because Hospitality Services is moving away from using
                        the MiraPay system. In this case, I carried that process out for Hospitality Services’ Online Services system
                        where people go to manage their meal plan accounts and funds. This was the main highlight of my co-op term, and I
                        was allowed to do it again for the Gowns system afterwards because I did it so fast with high quality (I finished
                        it in less than 2 weeks instead of the expected 1-2 months!). Refactoring the Gowns system for Moneris was much
                        more challenging because it was so much more complex and resulted in it being completed in just under 2 weeks as
                        well. I was especially proud of myself for revamping the receipts for each case of the transaction, refactoring
                        the complex Gowns code to be more manageable, and greatly improving internal and external documentation for these
                        related projects. Moreover, I even made a
                        <em><a href="uog-hs/Moneris Online HS and Gowns Task Documentation -censored.pdf" target="_blank">brief summary document</a></em>
                        about the Moneris tasks and integration process, including change history, integration process, example flow and
                        diagrams, and any other necessary information and links if someone were to work on this again or need to
                        troubleshoot/debug an issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After taking a quick peek at our Hospitality Asset Management System (HAMS) and its database after hearing my
                        supervisor discussing with others that there was an issue/bug, I solved it immediately and surprised them since
                        they did not know what was wrong besides the fact that they were unable to add more assets. Afterwards, at the
                        request of my boss, I also added an administrative account for the HAMS system permitting it to be the only
                        account with the ability to delete assets and users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last task during my term was a simple and straightforward structured task where I was instructed to add a
                        printer to VisualRATEX for the Campus Bookstore using Linux.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For quality assurance purposes, I was supposed to user acceptance test the new GET app and was looking forward to
                        the interesting assignment, as well as being the first student to use the new mobile/web app for ordering food
                        from on-campus establishments (pick-up only). However, the out-sourced team developing the vast majority of the
                        app was delayed and behind schedule due to circumstances and I never got the opportunity to before leaving.

                        <br /><i>NOTE: After talking with my boss, I will be reviewing it anyways outside of this co-op term and helping
                        them out -- I will update this page whenever that happens.</i>

                        <strong>CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving:</strong>
                        <b>Third-Party Credit Card Vendor Switch Within One Month</b>

                        <br /><u>Goal</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;My first task upon being hired (besides the PDF form side-task) was to implement a new
                        third-party credit card vendor, Moneris. The organization was switching to Moneris from MiraPay as the hosted
                        pay-page to pay using credit cards for Online Hospitality Services operations, such as meal plan top-ups.
                        I was told this should take approximately 2 months, and that doing it in 1 month would be very impressive.
                        Of course, my goal is to impressively complete this in one month or less.
                        
                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;In order to complete this within a month, I will need to conduct thorough and careful analysis
                        of the existing code base, the existing MiraPay system implementation, as well as large amounts of necessary
                        Moneris documentation, in order ensure I choose the right approach to changing the third-party credit card vendor
                        when considering budget, time, and feasible of the project. However, I will first have to learn the new languages
                        presented to me in the system (eg. MVC3/razor, C#, .NET, HTML/CSS). Using problem-solving skills and creative
                        thinking, I will make a decision after researching everything and discuss it with my supervisor before proceeding
                        with development.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Of course, this will be achieved if it is completed within 1 month; however, I would also want
                        to make sure I am not rushing things and the quality and documentation of the process and final product is above
                        standard. With regards to this qualitative aspect, my supervisor will be able to inform me of the success level.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;As the first task I was introduced to during my term here, I really wanted to impress them and
                        complete it in the smaller given time frame. Since I managed to finish everything including tests and put it live
                        in less than two weeks, I definitely achieved this goal. In addition, I completed it while following my other
                        goals and ensured it remained a high-quality work. Just take a look at my next goal to see that I also improved
                        the internal and external documentation, as well as refactoring the code. My supervisor was surprised (in a good
                        way) that I finished so fast without slacking on quality and testing. He was especially happy with the improved
                        receipts and when I took the initiative thinking up ideas of how we can make things even better. He rewarded me
                        by assigning a similar task where I had to do the same thing for a different system. Since this second system I
                        was implementing Moneris for was a lot more complex, it took me nearly another two weeks even though I had
                        experience with it and finished researching. You can take a look at this
                        <em><a href="uog-hs/Moneris Online HS and Gowns Task Documentation -censored.pdf" target="_blank">brief summary document</a></em>
                        I created to maybe get a little bit of a better idea about what I did for this project.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Working on this task reminded me once again just how important it is
                        to properly plan and prepare for each project before development. However, in retrospect I feel I still should
                        have been able to complete both Moneris tasks a little faster by not prioritizing the planning phase as heavily
                        in the initial stages. Instead of reading the entire Moneris website and applicable documentation, it would have
                        been better to break it into a few steps:
                        <br />&emsp;(1) Research different solutions to choose the best one for our system;
                        <br />&emsp;(2) Analyze our system and confirm the decided solution approach with supervisor;
                        <br />&emsp;(3) Implement Moneris into our system;
                        <br />&emsp;(4) Test that the new Moneris solution works properly.
                        <br />By breaking it down, I would have been able to streamline my process more and efficiently develop the product.

                        <b>PDF Form Creation</b>

                        <br /><u>Goal</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Learn and incorporate appropriate interactive PDF elements and scripting in order to create a
                        fillable PDF form that is automated and make it as good and user-friendly as possible.

                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;As I work on a task to create a fillable PDF form, I will go above and beyond to improve the
                        form at base level (eg. layout and appearance) from the
                        <em><a href="uog-hs/Sales and Solicitation Request Form -original.pdf" target="_blank">old version</a></em>
                        they provided. Then, I will conduct research about PDF interactive elements and
                        scripting (eg. Adobe Acrobat software). After preparing the new PDF form to be fillable and learning new PDF
                        scripting skills, I will proceed to add appropriate elements and scripts in order to automate the logic for
                        filling out the form. For example, using required fields and elements to ensure the user knows what fields they
                        need to fill out. By doing this, the form will become as user-friendly as possible and they will be unable to
                        submit an incomplete or incorrectly completed form.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Once the electronic PDF form incorporates all the same logic and reasoning used when someone
                        completes the form by hand, this will be accomplished. The user also should receive appropriate alerts when
                        forgetting to fill out fields so they know what is incorrect and what still needs to be filled out. Additionally,
                        a good measure of success would be when the supervisor who originally handles these forms approves of the form I
                        have created.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Having a detailed plan to tackle the task made completing it more straightforward and much
                        easier since I always knew what to do next. As PDF scripting was entirely new to me (although I am familiar with
                        JavaScript), I had to spend a fair amount of time researching what was possible as well as how to realize my ideas.
                        I was extremely satisfied with how well it turned out because I managed to put everything I personally wanted to
                        include on top of the requirements set by my supervisor.
                        The <em><a href="uog-hs/Sales and Solicitation Request Form.pdf" target="_blank">new form</a></em>
                        perfectly automated and worked as intended, receiving great praise from my supervisor and the department I made it for,
                        especially for the <em><a href="uog-hs/Sales and Solicitation Request Form Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">external document</a></em>
                        I created which explained its functionality, how to use and modify it, and even instructions detailing how to make
                        one from scratch.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;I also realized it is important to test the form on multiple OS and PDF viewing apps in order to
                        verify its function in different environments and I will continue to keep this in mind for the future. From this
                        experimentation, we had to include a short notice on what types of PDF readers were compatible and how to get and
                        use it on each OS. However, it was unfortunate the department posted it on their site after disabling the "Submit"
                        button, thus rendering nearly all the automation and functionality I added useless. Nonetheless, I greatly improved
                        even the core of the form because I rewrote it from scratch so I could give it a better appearance in comparison to
                        the reference initially provided. Working on this task reminded me once again just how important it is to properly
                        plan and prepare for each project before development.

                        <strong>LITERACY - Technological Literacy:</strong>
                        <b>Improve Code Documentation</b>

                        <br /><u>Goal</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;While working here so far, I have noticed that there is very little documentation within the code.
                        Therefore, I would like to make it my goal to enhance the code documentation of files I work on in order to improve
                        it for future developers. In order to document code properly, I will also increase my understanding of the system.
                        
                        <br /><u>Action Plan</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Generally, I will carry this out for all of my work; however, I will take specific note of a
                        task involving Moneris switch from MiraPay for the Gowns ordering system and use this to measure my success
                        besides an overall perspective.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;After I learn the new coding languages presented by the system (eg. ASP.NET, C#), I will
                        carefully examine the current codebase and system before coming to a decision and confirming my approach with my
                        supervisor. Then, throughout development I will add proper comments in the code that explain the logic of a code
                        block if it is not straightforward and easily apparent to a developer. While documenting, I will also bear in mind
                        that future co-ops will potentially work on this. Other than typical comments for code blocks and similar usual
                        comments, I will also add file comments and function comments using coding standards for documentation learned
                        from software design courses. Besides just documentation, I will modify the code itself to be "self-documenting"
                        where possible. For example, just by changing logical flow, function names, and variable names, the code can
                        become easier to read and understand. Therefore, I will also aim to refactor the code as I improve documentation.

                        <br /><u>Measure of Success</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;This goal will be successful when each task I complete also improves the documentation within the
                        code. In simpler terms, I will leave each file better than when I first started on it. I will create a checklist
                        related to coding standards of documentation to ensure I meet all guidelines. For example, this way I will ensure
                        that each function and file has a header comment. Additionally, I can ask my supervisor for code reviews to ensure
                        that the documentation is good and the code itself also "self-documents" and helps viewer understanding.

                        <br /><u>Reflection</u>
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;The personal checklist I created to aid with refactoring and adding documentation helped ensure
                        I did not miss anything. It also determined when a file met standards, which allowed me to efficiently refactor
                        and improve documentation for many areas because I was not spending extra time on any single file. I was very
                        happy with how much the codebase documentation improved, both internally and externally.
                        My supervisor was also very pleased about this and praised the extra work and effort to improve everything I worked
                        on, especially regarding documentation which was previously quite lacking. Although we never conducted formal code
                        reviews, my supervisor would look over my work and validate that everything was acceptable and high quality.
                        <br />&emsp;&emsp;Looking at code entirely new to me that lacked any form of documentation or even well-written,
                        self-documenting code during my work term here has reminded me that clear, concise, and thorough documentation is
                        necessary for a good project. Although one might be able to get away without it, including makes it much easier
                        for anyone new or even yourself if you need to look back at it in the future. I had literally nobody to ask for
                        help during my term as I was the only developer; however, my supervisor had previously written code for many of
                        the things I worked on. Unfortunately, he usually was unable to fully help since he had worked on it so long ago
                        and did not remember much, which would leave me solve almost all issues on my own. I will definitely continue to
                        uphold strong documentation standards in all my work because it is a good habit to possess.

                <!-- Conclusions -->
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;During my short ~2 months working in this position, I learned about many different things and was
                    constantly challenged, fostering growth in many areas, both technically and professionally. Although working
                    individually may seem quite enticing for some people, I do not think I would enjoy a position with such minimal
                    teamwork and interaction long-term. Perhaps if COVID-19 did not affect this job, I would be on a team with proper
                    procedures, but I am glad I learned this early in my career. Nonetheless, after this co-op, I find myself preferring
                    structured team workflow and proper development environments over what occurred these past 2 months even if that
                    means I would have less freedom.
                    
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;That being said, working by myself without any assistance was a great opportunity where I was able
                    to increase my confidence with independent development in the workplace. Since most other people were remote working
                    from home (WFH), I also became proficient writing clear and concise professional emails yet managed to include enough
                    detail when appropriate. Although I asked for more work and believed I could have been challenged with more tasks and
                    tougher assignments compared to what I received, I am still thankful for the valuable experience I accumulated working
                    here the past 2 months. It is my hope that the contributions I made during my time here will have a lasting impact for others.
                </p>

                <!-- Acknowledgements -->
                <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I would like to give a special thank you to the following people from Hospitality Services whom I worked with
                    for making an impact on my experience this summer and contributing to my personal and professional growth:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Altaf Virani, Assistant Director - Information Technology</li>
                    <li>Munny Malik, Assistant Manager - Information Technology</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Although I rarely interacted with Munny, I want to thank her for talking with me a little bit every time
                    she came in to work - actually talking to another person once in a while was nice after being alone in the office
                    every day. Even if it was brief, it was also a pleasure to work together when designing and creating a PDF form.
                    Last but not least, Altaf, my supervisor and only mentor during my co-op placement. I always enjoyed chatting with
                    you during the small respites between your busy schedule for us to update each other about work. Even when it was
                    not about the current projects, we usually got a good laugh or two every day.
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;I understand the difficulties we faced over the summer kept you quite busy, especially as you had
                    to make sure on-campus Hospitality Services was prepared for the return of classes and students coming back to
                    campus. Despite everything, you still tried your best to make me feel welcome and be available if I had any questions
                    about my work. I am very thankful for working with everyone and you can rest assured that I will remember and
                    transfer the many things I learned during my co-op term here into my other endeavors.
                </p>
